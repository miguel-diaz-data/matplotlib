The goal of this project is to look through the provided mouse research data for different drugs' efficacy with reducing tumor size. 

First the data was cleaned of mouse data that was erroneous, as it had conflicting timepoints and tumor volumes and metastatic sites. 

The mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error for the tumor size for each drug treatment were found. 

Figures showing the male/female ratio and number of mice under each treatment were created, of which there were more males than females by a small margin

The tumor volume over time of Capomulin was plotted in a line graph, with a noted reduction in tumor volume over time being seen in the average mouse in this treatment group. 

A scatterplot of the average tumor volume and the average weight of the mouse was plotted as well for mice in this regimen, and a positive linear regression between the two was found (R=0.84). These two findings about the drug raise the question of whether the drug is reducing tumor size directly or whether the drug is reducing mouse weight which in turn reduces the tumor size. Further comparisons of timepoints vs mouse weight might shed a light to that.
